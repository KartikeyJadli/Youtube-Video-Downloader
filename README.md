# Youtube-Video-Downloader

YouTube is an internationally known website for sharing videos. Unfortunately, when you use an online downloader to download a video or try to get it from a random website, you face the danger of your personal information being stolen.

The task of downloading videos is incredibly straightforward, efficient, and safe while using the Python Tkinter module. Moreover, it gets the video directly from YouTube for you.

To develop a video downloader, you should have;

1. An understanding of Python programming language.
2. Python package installed on your PC.
3. An editor of your choice.
4. Tkinter - A Python module for creating GUIs.
5. Pytube - Downloads the video from YouTube.
